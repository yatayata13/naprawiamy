<h2>About FixMyStreet</h2>

<p>
    FixMyStreet is an independent web service run by the charity <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> to make it easier for anyone to report a problem in their local area without needing to have any knowledge of council boundaries or responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
You can find the answers to many of our most frequently asked questions on <a href="/faq">our FAQ page</a>.
</p>

<h2>How to contact us</h2>

    Whether you’re looking for a quote, an interview, some images, or something else entirely, the mySociety press team is happy to help you with your story.
</p>

<p>
If you’re looking for statistics, we welcome enquiries about and support the use of FixMyStreet data for constructive research purposes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Please note</strong>, mySociety does not endorse the simplistic use of FixMyStreet data to <strong>compare, denounce or rank</strong> areas. This is because the data from FixMyStreet alone cannot be used to make fair comparisons at the national level. <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2024/02/06/statement-from-mysociety-regarding-misuse-of-fixmystreet-data/">Please read our statement on this</a>.
</p>

<p>
We are a small, fully remote organisation, so the best way to reach us is to email <strong>press&#64;mysociety.org</strong> and one of the team will respond to you as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Please note, we can’t respond to queries about reports made on FixMyStreet.</strong>

    <li>If you are following up on the status of your report, please contact the council or authority it was sent to directly (we only send reports to the people who can fix them for you; we can’t control what happens afterwards).</li>
