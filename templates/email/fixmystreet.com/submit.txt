Where did this report come from?

FixMyStreet is an independent service, built by the charity mySociety <https://www.mysociety.org/> to make it easier for citizens to report problems in their community. Read our FAQs <https://www.fixmystreet.com/about/information-for-councils/> to find out more about FixMyStreet.

Why has this report come to this email address?

We do our best to ensure reports go to the right place at each council. If there’s a better contact address for reports about [% category_footer %] issues, please let us know at <support@fixmystreet.com>. We can also add or remove categories if you wish.

How do we reply to this report?

Replies to this email will go directly into the report-maker's inbox. Your reply is not published on the FixMyStreet website (unless you use FixMyStreet Pro, which can display responses to help close the feedback loop).

Can you include more information in these reports?

If you need to receive extra data that isn’t currently included in the report, please let us know what’s missing at <support@fixmystreet.com>.

Do we have to receive email reports from FixMyStreet?

No! Local authorities no longer need to receive email reports from FixMyStreet as they can be integrated into existing council systems - and there are a few different ways this can be achieved.

How can FixMyStreet connect directly with council systems?

1. You can do this yourself (for free) using our Open311 API: <https://www.fixmystreet.com/about/open311-api-info>
2. We can build and maintain the integration for you (carries an annual fee)
3. You can become a FixMyStreet Pro <https://www.societyworks.org/services/highways/> user. FixMyStreet Pro is a more advanced version of FixMyStreet, which seeks to eliminate the significant costs councils incur from duplicate reporting, unnecessary contact and failure demand (we have the stats to prove it!).

As a charity our goal is to help improve services for citizens and local authorities. To find out more about connecting FixMyStreet to your own systems, please get in touch at <support@fixmystreet.com>.
