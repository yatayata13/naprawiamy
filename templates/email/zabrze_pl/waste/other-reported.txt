Dear [% report.name %],

Your [% subject_type %] to [% report.body %] has been logged.

[% IF cobrand.moniker == 'bromley' %]

[%# Nothing here at present %]

[% ELSIF cobrand.moniker == 'sutton' %]

[% IF report.category == 'Request new container' %]
Due to the current high demand, please allow up to
[% cobrand.wasteworks_config.request_timeframe %] for this
order to be processed. We thank you for your patience and understanding in
advance.

If you have requested a bin, box or caddy to be collected as part of the request:

* Please keep any bin, box or caddy accessible in your front garden or driveway, ready to be exchanged.

* It must be visible from the public highway, so delivery drivers can see it.

* We will not be able to exchange a bin, box or caddy if the old bin is not available, and you may not receive your replacement.
[% END %]

[% ELSIF cobrand.moniker == 'kingston' AND report.category == 'Request new container' %]

On delivery day - You do not need to be home for our crew to deliver the bin.

Collecting your old bin - If you've requested a collection of your old bin, we'll schedule a specific date for our
crew to remove it. We aim for this to be the same day as we deliver your new bin, but it could be a different day.

[% ELSE %]

[% IF report.category == 'Report missed collection' %]
[% IF cobrand.moniker == 'brent' %]
We will arrange another collection as soon as possible over the next two days. Please note that collections may also be attempted on a public holiday/weekend.
[% ELSE %]
We will arrange another collection as soon as possible over the next 2 working days.
[% END %]
[% ELSIF report.category == 'Request new container' %]
We aim to deliver this container to you within
[% cobrand.wasteworks_config.request_timeframe || '20 working days' %]. If
you have requested a replacement bin please leave your broken one
available for collection at the front of your property.
[% END %]
